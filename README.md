# PyOpenDmxUsb

PODU is an API for the [Enttec OPEN DMX USB](https://www.enttec.co.uk/en/product/controls/dmx-usb-interfaces/open-dmx-usb/) on **Windows** that lets your python programm easily controll any DMX device connected to it. It is build in two parts, a server and a client.

The Server is written in C# and connects to the USB interface to control the DMX devices. It is controlled by a python module over a named pipe.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to use PODU is to run the DMXServer with the following command:

```

DMXServer -n PODU

```

this will start the DMXServer and attach it to a named pipe called 'PODU'.

In Python use DMXClient like in the following example:

```py

from DMXClient import DMXClient

  

dmxClient = DMXClient("PODU")

dmxClient.connect()

dmxClient.write([16, 255, 17, 125])

dmxClient.write("DMX 18 90 19 40")

dmxClient.write({20:'30', '21': 243})

dmxClient.effect([12500, 22, 128])

dmxClient.effect("EFFECT 1500 23 176")

  

dmxClient.close()

```

As you can see, there are many different formats you can choose from.

## Usage

After getting an FMF object the following functions can be called:

### Connect to server

```py

dmxClient.connect()

```

This will block until connected to the DMXServer

### Set DMX values

```py

dmxClient.write(str)

dmxClient.write(list)

dmxClient.write(dict)

```

These will send command to the server setting the designated channels to the specified values

#### Faster method

As commands to the server are send as string you may also use the following method to get a tiny performance boost:

```py

dmxClient._write(str)

```

### Close connection to the server

```py

dmxClient.close()

```

This will close the connection to the DMXServer

### Effects/Animations

PODU provides you with an easy way to animate your channel values.
You can instruct the DMXServer to change the values of as many channels as you want to a specific one over x amounts of milliseconds(ms has to be divisible by the DMXServerÂ´s tickspeed which is normally set to 100ms).

```py
dmxClient.effect([time, channel, value...])
dmxClient.effect("EFFECT 12500 22 128")
```

Note that *all* channels used in the effect stay blocked until the *whole* effect is over.
  
## DMXServer Usage

```

Usage: DMXServer [OPTIONS]

DMXServer is the part of PODU that interfaces with the OPEN DMX USB.

  

Options:

-h Show this screen.

-n Name of named pipe (must be same as used by DMXClient).

-v Show verbose output.

-s Wait for another connection after a DMXClient disconnects.

```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

[pywin32](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32) to enable communication between c# and python

[Win D2XX Drivers](https://www.enttec.co.uk/en/product/controls/dmx-usb-interfaces/open-dmx-usb/) downloaded directly from Enttec's website

### Binarys

In order to use PODU you need the DMXClient(Python) and the DMXServer(C#), both of which can be downloaded on the [release](https://github.com/Coronon/PyOpenDmxUsb/releases) tab.

### Sources

You can also compile the DMXServer from source, it is located under 'C#/DMXServer.cs'.
